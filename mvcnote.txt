Routing 
Then ASP.NET Framework introduced the concept of Routing to eliminate the need of mapping each and every URL to a physical file. The Routing Concept enables us to define the URL pattern that maps to the request handler. 
That request handler can be a class (class methods) or file.

in the case of ASP.NET MVC Framework, the request handler is the Controller Methods i.e. action methods.

The Route defines the URL pattern and the handler information. The handler can be a physical file, such as an ASPX file in the case of the WebForms application. A handler can also be a class that processes the request, 
such as a controller in the case of the ASP.NET MVC application. 

Routing in ASP.NET MVC is a pattern matching mechanism that handles the incoming HTTP request (i.e. incoming URL) and figures out what to do with that incoming HTTP request.

When the client makes a request i.e. makes an HTTP Request, then that request is first received by the Routing Engine. Once the Routing engine receives an HTTP Request, 
then it figures out the URL Pattern of the incoming request and checks if that URL pattern is present in the Route table. If it found a matching URL pattern for the incoming 
request in the Route Table, then it fetches the corresponding handler information and forwards the request to the appropriate controller and action method.
 If there is no match found in the routing table for the incoming HTTP request URL Pattern, then it simply returns a 404 HTTP status code.
 The routing functionality is implemented in the System.Web.Routing.


Route Constraint
-------------------
to provide some restrictions to the url - a way to put some validation around the defined route.
Restrict to numeric Id only and for Restricting Controller and Actions.
id should be only numeric values or COntroller name in the url should start with caps or only given action methods shoud work.


 Attribute Routing in ASP.NET MVC
---------------------------------
Student.cs in Models folder
StudentController.cs in COntrollers folder with 3 action methods
3 cshtml files in Vies folder for the 3 controller action methods
In RouteCOnfig.cs give COntroller name as Student - but if its Home then also it worked why??

Here in RouteCOnfig- Controller name is Home, but no HomeController then how it worked - Run any cshtml view

https://localhost:44346/Student/GetStudentCourses?studentID=4

Implementing Attribute Routing in ASP.NET MVC

Just Add routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes() method within the RegisterRoutes() method of RouteConfig.cs file.


namespace AttributeRoutingDemoInMVC
{
    public class RouteConfig
    {
        public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
        {
            routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

            //Enabling attribute routing 
            routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes();

            routes.MapRoute(
                name: "Default",
                url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
                defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
            );
        }
    }
}
